	abstract = {Neural networks are investigated for predicting the magnitude of the largest seismic event in the following month based on the analysis of eight mathematically computed parameters known as seismicity indicators. The indicators are selected based on the Gutenberg-Richter and characteristic earthquake magnitude distribution and also on the conclusions drawn by recent earthquake prediction studies. Since there is no known established mathematical or even empirical relationship between these indicators and the location and magnitude of a succeeding earthquake in a particular time window, the problem is modeled using three different neural networks: a feed-forward Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation ({LMBP}) neural network, a recurrent neural network, and a radial basis function ({RBF}) neural network. Prediction accuracies of the models are evaluated using four different statistical measures: the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, the frequency bias, and the true skill score or R score. The models are trained and tested using data for two seismically different regions: Southern California and the San Francisco bay region. Overall the recurrent neural network model yields the best prediction accuracies compared with {LMBP} and {RBF} networks. While at the present earthquake prediction cannot be made with a high degree of certainty this research provides a scientific approach for evaluating the short-term seismic hazard potential of a region. © World Scientific Publishing Company.},

However, assuming that {EEP}'s are not accompanied by a significant magnetic anomaly, the {MT} disturbances can be reduced by applying the method of residual electric field calculations. In the present work, we present a Dynamic Neural Network ({DNN}) based prediction procedure. A {DNN} is employed to predict the behaviour of an ellectrotelluric time series with ultimate objective its application to earthquake prediction using electric precursors. To achieve such a goal, a learning phase is necessary, during which the synaptic weights of the {DNN} are adjusted according to an appropriate update law so as to minimize an error signal. Then the method proceeds to the prediction phase, where using the weight values resulted at the end of the learning phase the {DNN} predicts, the actual signal accurately.

In the present work, seismicity rate variations in the Carpathian-Pannoman region, Hungary, and the Peloponnesos-Aegean area, Greece, have been used to develop neural network models for the prediction of the origin times of large (M≥6.0) earthquakes. Three-layer feed-forward neural network models were constructed to analyse earthquake occurrences. Numerical experiments have been performed with the aim to find the optimum input set configuration which provides the best performance of a neural network. It was possible to reach sufficient training tolerance for the constructed networks (correspondence between predicted by the model outputs and known from experience outputs within the limits of given error thresholds) only when the input set contained seismicity rate values for different magnitude bands (when such data appeared representative enough) and also for more than one time intervals between large earthquakes. The specific structure of the network input generates the question of whether this configuration has some relationship to the physics of the strain accumulation and/or release process. The remarkably satisfactory performance of the constructed neural networks suggests the usefulness of the application of this tool in earthquake prediction problems. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two kinds of predictions are provided in this study: a) the probability of an earthquake, of magnitude equal or larger than a preset threshold magnitude, within the next 7. days, to happen; b) the probability of an earthquake of a limited magnitude interval to happen, during the next 7. days. First, the physical fundamentals related to earthquake occurrence are explained. Second, the mathematical model underlying {ANNs} is explained and the configuration chosen is justified. Then, the {ANNs} have been trained in both areas: The Alborán Sea and the Western Azores-Gibraltar fault. Later, the {ANNs} have been tested in both areas for a period of time immediately subsequent to the training period. Statistical tests are provided showing meaningful results. Finally, {ANNs} were compared to other well known classifiers showing quantitatively and qualitatively better results.

	abstract = {The major challenge in the development of earthquake early warning ({EEW}) systems is the achievement of a robust performance at largest possible warning time. We have developed a new method for {EEW} - called {PreSEIS} (Pre-{SEISmic}) - that is as quick as methods that are based on single station observations and, at the same time, shows a higher robustness than most other approaches. At regular time-steps after the triggering of the first {EEW} sensor, {PreSEIS} estimates the most likely source parameters of an earthquake using the available information on ground motions at different sensors in a seismic network. The approach is based on two-layer feed-forward neural networks to estimate the earthquake hypocenter location, its moment magnitude, and the expansion of the evolving seismic rupture. When applied to the Istanbul Earthquake Rapid Response and Early Warning System ({IERREWS}), {PreSEIS} estimates the moment magnitudes of 280 simulated finite faults scenarios (4.5 ≤ M ≤ 7.5) with errors of less than ±0.8 units after 0.5 sec, ±0.5 units after 7.5 sec, and ±0.3 units after 15.0 sec. In the same time intervals, the mean location errors can be reduced from 10 km over 6 km to less than 5 km, respectively. Our analyses show that the uncertainties of the estimated parameters (and thus of the warnings) decrease with time. This reveals a trade-off between the reliability of the warning on the one hand, and the remaining warning time on the other hand. Moreover, the ongoing update of predictions with time allows {PreSEIS} to handle complex ruptures, in which the largest fault slips do not occur close to the point of rupture initiation. The estimated expansions of the seismic ruptures lead to a clear enhancement of alert maps, which visualize the level and distribution of likely ground shaking in the affected region seconds before seismic waves will arrive.},

            In the last few years, deep learning has solved seemingly intractable problems, boosting the hope to find approximate solutions to problems that now are considered unsolvable. Earthquake prediction, the Grail of Seismology, is, in this context of continuous exciting discoveries, an obvious choice for deep learning exploration. We reviewed the literature of artificial neural network ({ANN}) applications for earthquake prediction (77 articles, 1994–2019 period) and found two emerging trends: an increasing interest in this domain over time and a complexification of {ANN} models toward deep learning. Despite the relatively positive results claimed in those studies, we verified that far simpler (and traditional) models seem to offer similar predictive powers, if not better ones. Those include an exponential law for magnitude prediction and a power law (approximated by a logistic regression or one artificial neuron) for aftershock prediction in space. Because of the structured, tabulated nature of earthquake catalogs, and the limited number of features so far considered, simpler and more transparent machine-learning models than {ANNs} seem preferable at the present stage of research. Those baseline models follow first physical principles and are consistent with the known empirical laws of statistical seismology (e.g., the Gutenberg–Richter law), which are already known to have minimal abilities to predict large earthquakes.},

	abstract = {Earthquake magnitude prediction is a challenging problem that has been widely studied during the last decades. Statistical, geophysical and machine learning approaches can be found in literature, with no particularly satisfactory results. In recent years, powerful computational techniques to analyze big data have emerged, making possible the analysis of massive datasets. These new methods make use of physical resources like cloud based architectures. California is known for being one of the regions with highest seismic activity in the world and many data are available. In this work, the use of several regression algorithms combined with ensemble learning is explored in the context of big data (1 {GB} catalog is used), in order to predict earthquakes magnitude within the next seven days. Apache Spark framework, H2O library in R language and Amazon cloud infrastructure were been used, reporting very promising results.},

	abstract = {A new earthquake prediction system is presented in this work. This method, based on the application of artiﬁcial neural networks, has been used to predict earthquakes in Chile, one of the countries with larger seismic activity. The input values are related to the b-value, the Bath’s law, and the Omori–Utsu’s law, parameters that are strongly correlated with seismicity, as shown in solid previous works. Two kind of prediction are provided in this study: The probability that an earthquake of magnitude larger than a threshold value happens, and the probability that an earthquake of a limited magnitude interval might occur, both during the next ﬁve days in the areas analyzed. For the four Chile’s seismic regions examined, with epicenters placed on meshes with dimensions varying from 0.5◦ × 0.5◦ to 1◦ × 1◦, a prototype of neuronal network is presented. The prototypes predict an earthquake every time the probability of an earthquake of magnitude larger than a threshold is sufﬁciently high. The threshold values have been adjusted with the aim of obtaining as few false positives as possible. The accuracy of the method has been assessed in retrospective experiments by means of statistical tests and compared with well-known machine learning classiﬁers. The high success rate achieved supports the suitability of applying soft computing in this ﬁeld and poses new challenges to be addressed.},

An additional advantage of using the {LSTM} networks is that the earthquake precursor data can be directly fed into the network without any elaborate preprocessing as required by other approaches. Furthermore, no prior information on abnormal data is needed by these networks as they are trained only using normal data.

The implication of these observations on the physics of fracture processes has given rise to a significant debate in the seismological community.

After reviewing the literature, long short-term memory ({LSTM}) is found to be a good option for building the model because of its memory-keeping ability. Using the Keras tuner, the best model was selected from candidate models, which are composed of combinations of various {LSTM} architectures and dense layers. This selected model used seismic indicators from the earthquake catalog of Bangladesh as features to predict earthquakes of the following month. Attention mechanism was added to the {LSTM} architecture to improve the model's earthquake occurrence prediction accuracy, which was 74.67\%.

Various kinds of technologies have been proposed to address this problem, such as mathematical analysis, machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, and precursors signal study. Unfortunately, they usually do not have very good results due to the seemingly dynamic and unpredictable nature of earthquakes. In contrast, we notice that earthquakes are spatially and temporally correlated because of the crust movement. Therefore, earthquake prediction for a particular location should not be conducted only based on the history data in that location, but according to the history data in a larger area. In this paper, we employ a deep learning technique called long short-term memory ({LSTM}) networks to learn the spatio-temporal relationship among earthquakes in different locations and make predictions by taking advantage of that relationship. Simulation results show that the {LSTM} network with two-dimensional input developed in this paper is able to discover and exploit the spatio-temporal correlations among earthquakes to make better predictions than before.},

	abstract = {Multivariate time series forecasting is an important machine learning problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. Temporal data arise in these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network ({LSTNet}), to address this open challenge. {LSTNet} uses the Convolution Neural Network ({CNN}) and the Recurrent Neural Network ({RNN}) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time series trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model to tackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, {LSTNet} achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods. All the data and experiment codes are available online.},

	abstract = {Popular graph neural networks implement convolution operations on graphs based on polynomial spectral filters. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional layer inspired by the auto-regressive moving average ({ARMA}) filter that, compared to polynomial ones, provides a more flexible frequency response, is more robust to noise, and better captures the global graph structure. We propose a graph neural network implementation of the {ARMA} filter with a recursive and distributed formulation, obtaining a convolutional layer that is efficient to train, localized in the node space, and can be transferred to new graphs at test time. We perform a spectral analysis to study the filtering effect of the proposed {ARMA} layer and report experiments on four downstream tasks: semi-supervised node classification, graph signal classification, graph classification, and graph regression. Results show that the proposed {ARMA} layer brings significant improvements over graph neural networks based on polynomial filters.},

	abstract = {This study utilizes two non-linear approaches to characterize model behavior of earthquake dynamics in the crucial tectonic regions of Northeast India ({NEI}). In particular, we have applied a (i) non-linear forecasting technique to assess the dimensionality of the earthquake-generating mechanism using the monthly frequency earthquake time series (magnitude ≥4) obtained from {NOAA} and {USGS} catalogues for the period 1960-2003 and (ii) artificial neural network ({ANN}) methods-based on the back-propagation algorithm ({BPA}) to construct the neural network model of the same data set for comparing the two. We have constructed a multilayered feed forward {ANN} model with an optimum input set configuration specially designed to take advantage of more completely on the intrinsic relationships among the input and retrieved variables and arrive at the feasible model for earthquake prediction. The comparative analyses show that the results obtained by the two methods are stable and in good agreement and signify that the optimal embedding dimension obtained from the non-linear forecasting analysis compares well with the optimal number of inputs used for the neural networks. The constructed model suggests that the earthquake dynamics in the {NEI} region can be characterized by a high-dimensional chaotic plane. Evidence of high-dimensional chaos appears to be associated with "stochastic seasonal" bias in these regions and would provide some useful constraints for testing the model and criteria to assess earthquake hazards on a more rigorous and quantitative basis. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {A computational approach is presented for predicting the location and time of occurrence of future moderate-to-large earthquakes in an approximate sense based on neural network modeling and using a vector of eight seismicity indicators as input. Two different methods are explored. In the first method, a large seismic region is subdivided into several small subregions and the temporal historical earthquake record is divided into a number of small equal time periods. Seismicity indicators are computed for each subregion for each time period and their relationship to the magnitude of the largest earthquake occurring in that subregion during the following time-period is studied using a recurrent neural network. In the second more direct approach, the temporal historical earthquake record is divided into a number of unequal time periods where each period is defined as the time between large earthquakes. Seismicity indicators are computed for each time-period and their relationship to the latitude and longitude of the epicentral location, and time of occurrence of the following major earthquake is studied using a recurrent neural network. © 2009 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03675},
	shorttitle = {Machine Learning on Graphs},
	abstract = {There has been a surge of recent interest in learning representations for graph-structured data. Graph representation learning methods have generally fallen into three main categories, based on the availability of labeled data. The first, network embedding (such as shallow graph embedding or graph auto-encoders), focuses on learning unsupervised representations of relational structure. The second, graph regularized neural networks, leverages graphs to augment neural network losses with a regularization objective for semi-supervised learning. The third, graph neural networks, aims to learn differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure. However, despite the popularity of these areas there has been surprisingly little work on unifying the three paradigms. Here, we aim to bridge the gap between graph neural networks, network embedding and graph regularization models. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of representation learning methods for graph-structured data, aiming to unify several disparate bodies of work. Specifically, we propose a Graph Encoder Decoder Model ({GRAPHEDM}), which generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs (e.g. {GraphSage}, Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks), and unsupervised learning of graph representations (e.g. {DeepWalk}, node2vec, etc) into a single consistent approach. To illustrate the generality of this approach, we fit over thirty existing methods into this framework. We believe that this unifying view both provides a solid foundation for understanding the intuition behind these methods, and enables future research in the area.},
